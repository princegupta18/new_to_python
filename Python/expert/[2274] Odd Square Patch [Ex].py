Create a function that takes an array of numbers, and returns the size of the biggest square patch of odd numbers. See examples for a clearer picture.


[Examples]

___
odd_square_patch([
  [1, 2, 4, 9],
  [4, 5, 5, 7],
  [3, 6, 1, 7]
]) ➞ 2

# The 2x2 square at the lower right
# ([5, 7] on the 2nd row, [1, 7] on the third).

odd_square_patch([[1, 2, 4, 9]]) ➞ 1

# An array with a single row can only have a square patch of
# maximum size 1x1 containing a single odd element.

odd_square_patch([[2, 4, 6]]) ➞ 0
