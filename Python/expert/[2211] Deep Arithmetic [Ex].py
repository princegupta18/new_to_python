####  Deep Arithmetic  ####

Create a function that takes an array of strings of arbitrary dimensionality ([], [][], [][][], etc) and returns the deep_sum of every separate number in each string in the array.


[Examples]

___
deep_sum(["1",  "five",  "2wenty",  "thr33"]) ➞ 36

deep_sum([["1X2",  "t3n"], ["1024", "5", "64"]]) ➞ 1099

deep_sum([[["1"], "10v3"],  ["738h"],  [["s0"],  ["1mu4ch3"], "-1s0"]]) ➞ 759
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Numbers in strings can be negative, but will all be base-10 integers.
*) Negative numbers may directly follow another number.
*) The hyphen or minus character ("-") does not only occur in numbers.
*) Arrays may be ragged or empty.
