####  Clockwise Decipher  ####

In Clockwise Cipher, encoding is done by placing message characters in the corner cells of a square and moving in a clockwise direction. The detailed description of the encoding algorithm is provided by Mubashir in his challenge. You are encouraged to solve that one first.
In this challenge, the function is given the encoded message. Create a reversed solution to retrieve the original message.


[Examples]

___
clockwise_decipher("Ms ussahr nHaaib") ➞ "Mubashir Hassan"

clockwise_decipher("M ParsoMc nhteat") ➞ "Matt MacPherson"
_____



[Notes]

Strip white spaces on the right of the resulting string, because they were added during the encoding.
