####  Complete the Pattern  ####

You will be given a string that is made up of some repeated pattern of characters. However, one of the characters in the string will be missing and replaced by an underscore. Write a function that returns the missing character.


[Examples]

___
complete_pattern("ABCABCA_CAB") ➞ "B"

complete_pattern("_ABAABAABA") ➞ "A"

complete_pattern("X+X*X+X*X+X_") ➞ "*"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The pattern will be repeated in full at least twice, though one of those repetitions may contain the missing character.
*) The string may end in the middle of a repetition of the pattern.
*) The pattern will never contain an underscore.
