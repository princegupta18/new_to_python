####  Finding the Missing Sides of a Right Triangle  ####

Consider a right triangle. Its area and hypotenuse are known.
Create a function that returns the two missing sides. The first input is the area and the second input is the hypotenuse. Return your answer as a list (the shorter side first). If there is no such right triangle, return "Does not exist".


[Examples]

___
f(3, 6) ➞ [1.015, 5.914]

f(30, 12) ➞ [5.675, 10.574]

f(30, 10) ➞ "Does not exist"
_____



[Notes]

Round your answer to three decimal places.
