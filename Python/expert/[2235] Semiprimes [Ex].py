####  Semiprimes  ####

In mathematics, a semiprime is a natural number that is the product of two prime numbers. The two primes in the product may equal each other, so the semiprimes include the squares of prime numbers.
Create a function that takes a number n as an argument and returns two lists, one list with all the semiprimes < n and the other with all the semiprimes < n and that are not square numbers.


[Examples]

___
semiprimes(20) ➞ ([4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15], [6, 10, 14, 15])

semiprimes(157) ➞ ([4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46, 49, 51, 55, 57, 58, 62, 65, 69, 74, 77, 82, 85, 86, 87, 91, 93, 94, 95, 106, 111, 115, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 129, 133, 134, 141, 142, 143, 145, 146, 155], [6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46, 51, 55, 57, 58, 62, 65, 69, 74, 77, 82, 85, 86, 87, 91, 93, 94, 95, 106, 111, 115, 118, 119, 122, 123, 129, 133, 134, 141, 142, 143, 145, 146, 155])
