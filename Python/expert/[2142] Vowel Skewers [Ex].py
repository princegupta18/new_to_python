####  Vowel Skewers  ####

An authentic vowel skewer is a skewer with a delicious and juicy mix of consonants and vowels. However, the way they are made must be just right:
___
*) Skewers must begin and end with a consonant.
*) Skewers must alternate between consonants and vowels.
*) There must be an even spacing between each letter on the skewer, so that there is a consistent flavour throughout.
___

Create a function which returns whether a given vowel skewer is authentic.


[Examples]

___
is_authentic_skewer("B--A--N--A--N--A--S") ➞ True

is_authentic_skewer("A--X--E") ➞ False
# Should start and end with a consonant.

is_authentic_skewer("C-L-A-P") ➞ False
# Should alternate between consonants and vowels.

is_authentic_skewer("M--A---T-E-S") ➞ False
# Should have consistent spacing between letters.
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All tests will be given in uppercase.
*) Strings without any actual skewer "-" or letters should return False.
