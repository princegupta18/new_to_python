####  English to Pig Latin Translator  ####

Pig latin has two very simple rules:

Write two functions to make an English to pig latin translator. The first function translate_word(word) takes a single word and returns that word translated into pig latin. The second function translate_sentence(sentence) takes an English sentence and returns that sentence translated into pig latin.


[Examples]

___
translate_word("flag") ➞ "agflay"

translate_word("Apple") ➞ "Appleyay"

translate_word("button") ➞ "uttonbay"

translate_word("") ➞ ""

translate_sentence("I like to eat honey waffles.") ➞ "Iyay ikelay otay eatyay oneyhay afflesway."

translate_sentence("Do you think it is going to rain today?") ➞ "Oday ouyay inkthay ityay isyay oinggay otay ainray odaytay?"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Regular expressions will help you not mess up the punctuation in the sentence.
*) If the original word or sentence starts with a capital letter, the translation should preserve its case (see examples #2, #5 and #6).
