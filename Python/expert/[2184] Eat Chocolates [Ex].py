####  Eat Chocolates  ####

Arun recently started eating chocolates. The shopkeeper tells Arun that for every three chocolates Arun eats, he will give him one chocolate in exchange for three chocolate wrappers. Now, Arun is confused about how many chocolates he can eat.
Given the total_money Arun has and the cost_of_one_chocolate, help him figure out how many chocolates he can eat.


[Examples]

___
count_eatable_chocolates("4$", "1$") ➞ 5
# Arun eats three chocolates and purchases one more
# chocolate from Bitu in those three wrappers. Now he
# eats those two chocolates and hence 3 + 2 = 5.

count_eatable_chocolates("55   $", "5$") ➞ 16

count_eatable_chocolates("I have 68$", "2$")  ➞ 50

count_eatable_chocolates("I got -68$ from my mom ", "2$")  ➞ "Invalid Input"
# Because -68 is a negative number and money can't be negative.
_____



[Notes]

Figure out the invalid inputs and take care of them.
