####  Recursion: Farey Sequence  ####

The Farey sequence of order n is the set of all fractions with a denominator between 1 and n (reduced to its lowest terms and ordered ascendingly). Given an n, write a function that returns the Farey sequence as a list, with a string representation of each fraction of the form "numerator/denominator".


[Examples]

___
farey(1) ➞ ["0/1", "1/1"]

farey(5) ➞ ["0/1", "1/5", "1/4", "1/3", "2/5", "1/2", "3/5", "2/3", "3/4", "4/5", "1/1"]

farey(7) ➞ ["0/1", "1/7", "1/6", "1/5", "1/4", "2/7", "1/3", "2/5", "3/7", "1/2", "4/7", "3/5", "2/3", "5/7", "3/4", "4/5", "5/6", "6/7", "1/1"]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The sequence should always start with "0/1" and end with "1/1".
*) Optional: Try to solve this with the least lines of code. The shortest solution by far is a lambda function with 149 characters in it, excluding spaces and line break.
