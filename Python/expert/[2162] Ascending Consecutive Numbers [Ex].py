ascending("232425") ➞ True
# Consecutive numbers 23, 24, 25

ascending("2324256") ➞ False
# No matter how this string is divided, the numbers are not consecutive.

ascending("444445") ➞ True
# Consecutive numbers 444 and 445.

A number can consist of any number of digits, so long as the numbers are adjacent to each other, and the string has at least two of them.
