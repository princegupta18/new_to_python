####  Climbing Stairs  ####

A staircase is given with a non-negative cost per each step. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. Create a solution to find the minimum sum of costs to reach the top (finishing the payments including cost[-2] or cost[-1]). You can either start at cost[0] or cost[1].


[Examples]

___
climbing_stairs([0, 2, 2, 1]) ➞ 2

climbing_stairs([0, 2, 3, 2]) ➞ 3

climbing_stairs([10, 15, 20]) ➞ 15

climbing_stairs([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ 0
