####  Black Holes  ####

A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing⁠ — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light ⁠— can escape from it.
The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes historically referred to as the gravitational radius) is a physical parameter that shows up in the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations, corresponding to the radius defining the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.


[Objective]

Create a function that takes the name and the mass (in solar masses) of a black hole as an argument and returns the Schwarzschild radius, the Schwarzschild density and the type of black hole.
Consider:
___
c = 299792458
G = 6.67430e-11
pi = 3.141592
sun_mass = 1.99e30
_____

Types of black holes:



[Examples]

___
black_holes("APM 08279+5255", 2.3e10) ➞

---------- Black Hole APM 08279+5255 ----------

Schwarzschild radius = 6.80e+13 m
Schwarzschild density = 3.48e-02 kg/m3
Type of black hole = Supermassive black hole

black_holes("Messier 87", 7.22e9) ➞

---------- Black Hole Messier 87 ----------

Schwarzschild radius = 2.13e+13 m
Schwarzschild density = 3.53e-01 kg/m3
Type of black hole = Supermassive black hole

black_holes("Messier 110", 1.45e4) ➞

---------- Black Hole Messier 110 ----------

Schwarzschild radius = 4.29e+07 m
Schwarzschild density = 8.75e+10 kg/m3
Type of black hole = Intermediate-mass black hole
_____



[Notes]

Express the Schwarzschild radius and the Schwarzschild density using scientific notation with two decimal places.
