####  The Islands  ####

Create a function that takes a matrix as an argument and returns the number of "islands" in the matrix, as well as the quantity of "islands" by type.
___
*) You are given a matrix of nxm elements.
*) Each element represents either water (0) or land (1).
*) You must determine the total number of "islands" in the matrix (or map, if you want).
*) An island is a formation of one or more 1, connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
___

Finally, the program must calculate the number of islands by type:
