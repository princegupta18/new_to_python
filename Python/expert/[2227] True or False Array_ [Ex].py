####  True or False Array?  ####

I admit, this challenge is somehow strange. The objective is to find out if a given list is True or False. Here are some True lists:
___
[12, 40, 4, 6420, 20, 24, 400, 24]
[12.3, 46, 4, 7383, 23, 27, 529, 27.6]
[14, 80, 6, 12840, 40, 46, 1600, 48]
_____

And here some False lists:
___
[18.1, 162, 9, 26091, 81, 90, 6561, 97]
[14.5, 90, 18, 14445, 18, 51, 2025, 54]
[19.2, 184, 9, 29592, 92, 101, 8464, 110.8]
_____

All 8 values in the lists are connected in some way, you have to find out what the connection is. Go and play around with the 150 test cases and you'll figure it out.


[Examples]

___
tf_lst([12, 40, 4, 6420, 20, 24, 400, 24]) ➞ True

tf_lst([18.1, 162, 9, 26091, 81, 90, 6561, 97]) ➞ False

tf_lst([14.7, 94, 6, 15087, 47, 53, 2209, 56.4]) ➞ True
_____
