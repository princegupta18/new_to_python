####  Pascal's Triangle Rows  ####

Create a function that returns the nth row of Pascal's triangle:



[Examples]

___
pascal_row(0) ‚ûû [1]

pascal_row(1) ‚ûû [1, 1]

pascal_row(5) ‚ûû [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]

pascal_row(10) ‚ûû [1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1]
_____



[Notes]

Input will include large numbers (the formula n choose k, or n!/(k!*(n-k)!) won't do).
