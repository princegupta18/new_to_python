####  Bitwise Logical Negation  ####

Given a number (positive, negative, or 0), return the logical negation (as a 1 or 0) of that number. Do so using only bitwise operators:
___
(~, &, |, ^, >>, <<, etc) and +
_____

Any of these characters/constructs are not allowed:
___
if, do, while, for, -, not, or, and, is, [,] and any functions.
_____



[Examples]

___
bitwise_logical_negation(1) ➞ 0

bitwise_logical_negation(5) ➞ 0

bitwise_logical_negation(0) ➞ 1

bitwise_logical_negation(3) ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

Use as few operators as possible for more of a challenge.
