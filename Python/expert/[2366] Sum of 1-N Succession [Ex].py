####  Sum of 1-N Succession  ####

In this challenge you must create a program which takes a number n and returns the length or number of digits in all numbers from 1 to n concatenated.


[Examples]

___
concatenation_sum(5) ➞ 5

concatenation_sum(10) ➞ 11

concatenation_sum(13) ➞ 17
_____



[Notes]

Keep in mind that the output is the number of digits in the concatenated number. For example, if the input was 5, the output would be 5 because 12345 has 5 digits. Similarly when the input is 13 the ouput is 17 because 12345678910111213 has 17 digits.
