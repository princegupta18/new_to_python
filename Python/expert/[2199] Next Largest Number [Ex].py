####  Next Largest Number  ####

Write a function that returns the next number that can be created from the same digits as the input.


[Examples]

___
next_number(19) ➞ 91

next_number(3542) ➞ 4235

next_number(5432) ➞ 5432

next_number(58943) ➞ 59348
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If no larger number can be formed, return the number itself.
*) Bonus: See if you can do this without generating all digit permutations.
