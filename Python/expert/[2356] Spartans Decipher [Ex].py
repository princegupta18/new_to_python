####  Spartans Decipher  ####

In Spartans Cipher, encoding is done by writing the text horizontally, across the strap in the plaintext word of a message. In ancient times, Spartans and Greeks invented interesting way of encryption called Scytale. The detailed description of the encoding algorithm is provided by Mubashir in his challenge. You are encouraged to solve that one first.
In this challenge, the function is given the encoded message and the number of slides. Create a reversed solution to retrieve the original message.


[Examples]

___
spartans_decipher("Ms t euhSaC biclo aryed", 6) ➞ "Mubashir Scytale Code"

spartans_decipher("M  baai aaEirmn tndteag tda  z", 8) ➞ "Matt and Edabit are amazing"
_____



[Notes]

Strip white spaces on the right of the resulting string, because they were added during the encoding.
