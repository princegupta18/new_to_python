####  Number of Lucky Tickets  ####

Create a function that counts how many n-digit numbers have the same sum of the first half and second half of the digits (“lucky” numbers). The number n is even. For example, for n = 6, the numbers "001010", "112220", "000000" are lucky.


[Examples]

___
lucky_ticket(2) ➞ 10

lucky_ticket(4) ➞ 670

lucky_ticket(12) ➞ 39581170420
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The function should be really efficient.
*) The runtime increases 10 fold per test. Just for information: my solution takes 6 seconds, which is still under the server time-limit, so you are good to go.
