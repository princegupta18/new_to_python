####  camelCase ⇄ snake_case  ####

Create two functions to_camel_case() and to_snake_case() that each take a single string and convert it into either camelCase or snake_case. If you're not sure what these terms mean, check the Resources tab above.


[Examples]

___
to_camel_case("hello_edabit") ➞ "helloEdabit"

to_snake_case("helloEdabit") ➞ "hello_edabit"

to_camel_case("is_modal_open") ➞ "isModalOpen"

to_snake_case("getColor") ➞ "get_color"
_____



[Notes]

Test input will always be appropriately formatted as either camelCase or snake_case, depending on the function being called.
