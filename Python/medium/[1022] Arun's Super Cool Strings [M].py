####  Arun's Super Cool Strings  ####

Arun was playing random games with numbers, and he realized that four is a number whose English reformation (i.e. FOUR, also has four letters). He noticed an interesting pattern.
Arun starts with a few chosen strings and lands upon a number that has the same number of letters in it as the magnitude of the number (e.g. Alienware-Computers has nineteen letters in it, nineteen has eight letters, eight has five and five has four letters and four again has four letters in it).
So, Alienware-Computers is a super cool string as this word can be converted into a number which has the same length as it's magnitude when the given string is written in English.
Arun has a few more strings. Help him figure out if they're super cool or not.


[Examples]

___
is_super_cool("A") ➞ True
# "A" has one letter.
# One has three letters.
# Three has five letters.
# Five has four letters.
# Four has four letters.

is_super_cool("Nura") ➞ True)

is_super_cool("") ➞ False
_____

This challenge is possible without using loops.
