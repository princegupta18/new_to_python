####  The Nearest Element  ####

Given a list of integers lst, implement a function that returns the index of the number nearest to the given value n. If two numbers equally distant from n are found, the function will return the greatest of them.


[Examples]

___
nearest_element(10, [1, 100, 1000]) ➞ 0
# 1 is the number nearest to 10.

nearest_element(50, [100, 49, 51]) ➞ 2
# 49 and 51 are equally distant from 50, with 51 being the greatest.

nearest_element(-20, [-50, -10, -30]) ➞ 1
# -10 and -30 are equally distant from -20, with -10 being the greatest.

Integers in lst will always be unique.
