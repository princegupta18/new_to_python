####  Count the Points in a Circle  ####

Count the total number of coordinates on a two-dimensional grid that are inside a given circle. The function has four parameters: the points (provided as a list of dictionaries), the circle's center x coordinate, the circle's center y coordinate, and the circle's radius.


[Examples]

___
points_in_circle([
  { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
  { "x": 1, "y": 1 },
  { "x": 0, "y": 5 },
  { "x": 10, "y": 10 }
], 0, 0, 5) âžž 2
_____



[Notes]

Only count the coordinates that are in the circle, not the ones that are on the border.
