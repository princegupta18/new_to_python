####  Generate a List of 15 Palindrome Numbers  ####

In this challenge, you have to find the last 15 palindromes of all numbers starting from ten and up to a given limit, including the limit in the search.
Given an integer limit being the upper limit of the range of interest, implement a function that returns the last 15 palindromes numbers lower or equal to limit as a list sorted ascendingly.

What is a Palindromic Number?
http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/IntegerReps/palindromes.html
A palindromic number is one that is the same when the digits are reversed, for example 18381. All numbers turn out to be palindromes in some number base.
