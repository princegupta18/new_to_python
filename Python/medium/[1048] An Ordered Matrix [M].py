####  An Ordered Matrix  ####

Create an ordered 2D list (matrix). A matrix is ordered if its (0, 0) element is 1, its (0, 1) element is 2, and so on. Your function needs to create an a × b matrix. a is the first argument and b is the second.


[Examples]

___
ordered_matrix(5, 5) ➞ [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
  [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
  [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
]

ordered_matrix(1, 1) ➞ [[1]]

ordered_matrix(1, 5) ➞ [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) a is the height of the matrix (y coordinate), and b is the width (x coordinate).
*) a and b will always be positive, and the matrix will always be square shaped (in each row are the same amount of columns).
*) a and b are integers.
