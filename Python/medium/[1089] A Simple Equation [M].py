####  A Simple Equation  ####

Mubashir needs your help to make a simple equation. Create a function which takes three numbers: a, b and c, and returns an equation as a string using simple arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
Return any one of the possible answers to pass the tests. If there is no equation between a,b and c then return "".


[Examples]

___
simple_equation(1, 2, 3) ➞ "1+2=3" or "2+1=3" or "3-2=1" or "3-1=2"

simple_equation(2, 2, 4) ➞ "2+2=4" or "2*2=4" or "4/2=2" or "4-2=2"

simple_equation(6, 2, 3) ➞ "2*3=6" or "3*2=6" or "6/2=3" or "6/3=2"
