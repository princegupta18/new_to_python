####  Check If the Brick Fits through the Hole  ####

Write the function that takes three dimensions of a brick: height(a), width(b) and depth(c) and returns True if this brick can fit into a hole with the width(w) and height(h).


[Examples]

___
does_brick_fit(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) ➞ True

does_brick_fit(1, 2, 1, 1, 1) ➞ True

does_brick_fit(1, 2, 2, 1, 1) ➞ False
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You can turn the brick with any side towards the hole.
*) We assume that the brick fits if its sizes equal the ones of the hole (i.e. brick size should be less than or equal to the size of the hole, not strictly less).
*) You can't put a brick in at a non-orthogonal angle.

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
