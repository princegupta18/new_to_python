####  A Simple Comparison  ####

Mubashir needs your help to compare two lists.
First list lst1 contains some numbers and second list lst2 contains squared values of numbers given in the first list.
Create a function which takes these two lists and returns True if all square values are available, False otherwise.
___
lst1 = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
lst2 = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
_____

Returns True because 121 is square of 11, 14641 is square of 121, 20736 is square of 144, 361 is square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on...
___
lst1 = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] 
lst2 = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
_____



[Examples]

___
simple_comp([121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11], [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]) ➞ True

simple_comp([4, 4], [1, 31]) ➞ False

simple_comp([2, 2, 3], [4, 4, 9]) ➞ True
_____



[Notes]

Numbers can be in any order.
