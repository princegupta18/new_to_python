####  RegEx VI: Positive lookbehind  ####

Write a regular expression that will help us count how many tall people work in your company. You must use RegEx positive lookbehind.


[Example]

___
lst = ["tall height", "tall height", "short height", "medium height", "tall height"]
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

len(re.findall(pattern, ", ".join(lst))) ➞ 3
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You don't need to write a function just the pattern.
*) Do not remove import re from the code.
*) Find more info on RegEx and positive lookbehind in Resources.
*) You can find all the challenges of this series in my Basic RegEx collection.
