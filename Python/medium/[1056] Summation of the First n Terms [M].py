####  Summation of the First n Terms  ####

Create a function that takes an expression exp and an upper limit i as arguments and returns the sum of that expression up to the i'th term (recall sigma from math class).


[Examples]

___
summation("n", 10) ➞ 55

summation("1/n", 50) ➞ 4.5

summation("n**n", 6) ➞ 50069
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Assume the lower limit is i = 1.
*) Round your answer to the nearest tenth.

Allows us to write a long sum in a single expression. We can describe sums with multiple terms using the sigma operator, Σ. Learn how to evaluate sums written this way.
