####  Hidden Calculator Words  ####

At school, we used to play with our calculators and send each other secret messages. The trick was to enter a special number and turn the calculator upside-down. LOL ... I mean 707!
Given a number, create a function that converts it into a word by turning the integer 180 degrees around.


[Examples]

___
turn_calc(707) ➞ "LOL"

turn_calc(5508) ➞ "BOSS"

turn_calc(3045) ➞ "SHOE"
_____
