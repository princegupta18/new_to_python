####  Author Sorting  ####

Create a function which sorts a list of authors by their last name. The list may include initials and fullnames, but note that there will be a mix of upper and lowercase.


[Examples]

___
sort_authors(["J. K. Rowling", "w. s.", "lewis carroll", "M. M."]) ➞ ["lewis carroll", "M. M.", "J. K. Rowling", "w. s."]

sort_authors(["J. L.", "J. B. priestley", "L. C.", "Suzanne Collins"]) ➞ ["L. C.", "Suzanne Collins", "J. L.", "J. B. priestley"]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If two surnames begin with the same letter, return them in the order they appeared.
*) Note how there are spaces between each of the initials.
