####  Emphasise the Words  ####

The challenge is to recreate the functionality of the title() method into a function called emphasise(). The title() method capitalises the first letter of every word and lowercases all of the other letters in the word.


[Examples]

___
emphasise("hello world") ➞ "Hello World"

emphasise("GOOD MORNING") ➞ "Good Morning"

emphasise("99 red balloons!") ➞ "99 Red Balloons!"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You won't run into any issues when dealing with numbers in strings.
*) Please don't use the title() method directly :(
