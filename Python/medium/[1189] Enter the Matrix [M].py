####  Enter the Matrix  ####

In this challenge, you have to obtain a sentence from the elements of a given matrix. In the matrix, each word of the sentence follows a columnar order from the top to the bottom, instead of the usual left-to-right order: it's time for transposition!
Given a matrix mtx, implement a function that returns the complete sentence as a string, with the words separated by a space between them.


[Examples]

___
transpose_matrix([
  ["Enter"],
  ["the"],
  ["Matrix!"]
]) ➞ "Enter the Matrix!"

transpose_matrix([
  ["The", "are"],
  ["columns", "rows."]
]) ➞ "The columns are rows."

transpose_matrix([
  ["You", "the"],
  ["must", "table"],
  ["transpose", "order."]
]) ➞ "You must transpose the table order."

[Notes]

___
*) All given matrices are regular, as to say that each column has the same length.
*) Punctuation is already given, you just have to add the spaces in the returned string.
