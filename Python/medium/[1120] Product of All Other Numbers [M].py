####  Product of All Other Numbers  ####

You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.


[Examples]

___
get_products([1, 7, 3, 4]) ➞ [84, 12, 28, 21]

get_products([1, 2, 6, 5, 9]) ➞ [540, 270, 90, 108, 60]

get_products([1, 2, 3, 0, 5]) ➞ [0, 0, 0, 30, 0]

[Notes]

You can't use division, otherwise you might end up dividing by 0 and the universe would end.
