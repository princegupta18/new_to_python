####  Safecracker  ####

Traditional safes use a three-wheel locking mechanism, with the safe combination entered using a dial on the door of the safe. The dial is marked with clockwise increments between 0 and 99. The three-number combination is entered by first dialling to the right (clockwise), then to the left (anti-clockwise), and then to the right (clockwise) again. Combination numbers are read from the top of the dial:

Given the starting (top) position of the dial and the increments used for each turn of the dial, return a list containing the combination of the safe.


[Step-By-Step Example]

___
safecracker(0, [3, 10, 5]) ➞ [97, 7, 2]

Starting dial position of 0 (same as the diagram above).

First turn (rightward) of 3 increments:
0 -> 99, 98, 97
First number of combination = 97

Second turn (leftward) of 10 increments:
97 -> 98, 99, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Second number of combination = 7

Third turn (rightward) of 5 increments:
7 -> 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
Third number of combination = 2

The final combination is [97, 7, 2]

[Other Examples]

___
safecracker(96, [54, 48, 77]) ➞ [42, 90, 13]

safecracker(43, [51, 38, 46]) ➞ [92, 30, 84]

safecracker(4, [69, 88, 55]) ➞ [35, 23, 68]

[Notes]

Each of the three combination numbers will be different.
