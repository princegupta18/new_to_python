####  First Tuesday of the Month  ####

Every month, Microny™️ (a big entertainment corporation) publishes a few free videogames on their web store. You are working on a script that will notify you whenever the new games are available for download. There is not a fixed date for the new releases, but you know that it happens every first Tuesday of every month.
Write a function that, given a year and a month, returns a string with the date of when the new games will be available.


[Examples]

___
first_tuesday_of_the_month(1997, 1) ➞ "1997-01-07"

first_tuesday_of_the_month(2021, 2) ➞ "2021-02-02"

first_tuesday_of_the_month(2020, 3) ➞ "2020-03-03"
