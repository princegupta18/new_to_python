####  Wait... Who Am I?  ####

Hello there, I... seem to not remember who I am, my memories is all... cloudy, although maybe if I could piece it together...
Oh! Maybe you could help me make a class that helps me remember things. Maybe a method called add that would add to my memory if I would recall things and a remember method that would let me recall a specific memory.
But you have to make add more flexible, I might recall many things in an instant or only one that I would forget again.


[Examples :D]

___
# add method doesn't return anything.
memories.add(name="Shane", gender="M", catch_phrase="bazinga")

memories.add(work="None", love_life=0)

memories.add(adress="car")

memories.remember("work") ➞ "None"

memories.remember("gender") ➞ "M"

# If memory was not added, return False
memories.remember("lover") ➞ False
_____



[Notes]

The add method should be able to handle any number of arguments.
