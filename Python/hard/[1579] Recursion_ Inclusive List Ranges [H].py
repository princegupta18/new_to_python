####  Recursion: Inclusive List Ranges  ####

Write a function that, given the start start_num and end end_num values, return a list containing all the numbers inclusive to that range. See examples below.


[Examples]

___
inclusive_list(1, 5) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

inclusive_list(2, 8) ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

inclusive_list(10, 20) ➞ [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

inclusive_list(17, 5) ➞ [17]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The numbers in the list are sorted in ascending order.
*) If start_num is greater than end_num, return a list with the higher value. See example #4.
*) An iterative version of this challenge can be found via this link.
