find_missing([[1], [1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]) ➞ 3

find_missing([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1]]) ➞ 3

find_missing([[4, 4, 4, 4], [1], [3, 3, 3]]) ➞ 2

*) Test input lists won't always be sorted in order of length.
*) If the list of lists is None or empty, your function should return False.
