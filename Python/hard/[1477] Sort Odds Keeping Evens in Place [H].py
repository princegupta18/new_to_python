####  Sort Odds Keeping Evens in Place  ####

Write a function that sorts only the odd numbers in a list in ascending order, keeping the even numbers in their current place.
For example, if our input list is: [5, 2, 6, 6, 1, 4, 9, 3]:
___
[_, 2, 6, 6, _, 4, _, _]  # Keep evens in place.

# Sort odds: [5, 1, 9, 3] => [1, 3, 5, 9]

[1, 2, 6, 6, 3, 4, 5, 9] # Final list.
_____



[Examples]

___
odd_sort([7, 5, 2, 3, 1]) ➞ [1, 3, 2, 5, 7]

odd_sort([3, 7, 0, 9, 3, 2, 4, 8]) ➞ [3, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2, 4, 8]

odd_sort([2, 2, 8, 4]) ➞ [2, 2, 8, 4]

odd_sort([7, 9, 7]) ➞ [7, 7, 9]
_____
