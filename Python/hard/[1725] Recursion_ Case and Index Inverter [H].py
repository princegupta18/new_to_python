####  Recursion: Case and Index Inverter  ####

Write a recursive function that takes a string input and returns the string in a reversed case and order.


[Examples]

___
invert("dLROW YM sI HsEt") ➞ "TeSh iS my worlD"

invert("ytInIUgAsnOc") ➞ "CoNSaGuiNiTY"

invert("step on NO PETS") ➞ "step on NO PETS"

invert("XeLPMoC YTiReTXeD") ➞ "dExtErIty cOmplEx"
_____



[Notes]
