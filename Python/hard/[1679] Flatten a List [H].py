####  Flatten a List  ####

Create a function that takes a list. This list can have all kinds of primitives, even other lists. The function should return a single, flat, one-dimensional, list with all elements. Here are the conditions:

flatten_list([1]) ➞ [1]

flatten_list([]) ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

If no input is given it should return an empty list: [].
