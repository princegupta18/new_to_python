####  Recursion: Pronic Number  ####

A pronic number (or otherwise called as heteromecic) is a number which is a product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of the form n(n + 1). Create a function that determines whether a number is pronic or not.


[Examples]

___
is_heteromecic(0) ➞ True
# 0 * (0 + 1) = 0 * 1 = 0

is_heteromecic(2) ➞ True
# 1 * (1 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2

is_heteromecic(7) ➞ False

is_heteromecic(110) ➞ True
# 10 * (10 + 1) = 10 * 11 = 110

is_heteromecic(136) ➞ False

is_heteromecic(156) ➞ True
