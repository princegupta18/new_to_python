####  Growing and Shrinking Potions  ####

There are two types of potions:

___
*) If "A" immediately follows a digit, add 1 to the digit.
*) If "B" immediately follows a digit, subtract 1 from the digit.
___

Create a function that returns a string according to these rules, removing the potions once they've been consumed.


[Examples]

___
after_potion("3A78B51") ➞ "47751"
# 3 grows to 4, 8 shrinks to 7

after_potion("9999B") ➞ "9998"

after_potion("9A123") ➞ "10123"

after_potion("567") ➞ "567"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Digits that do not have a potion on their immediate right should be left alone.
*) A digit will always either be followed by zero or exactly 1 potion.
