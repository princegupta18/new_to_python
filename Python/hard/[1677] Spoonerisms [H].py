####  Spoonerisms  ####

A spoonerism is when the first letters / sounds of two words are transposed onto one another. Create a function that takes a two-word string and performs a spoonerism on the phrase.


[Examples]

___
spoonerise("history lecture") ➞ "listory hecture"

spoonerise("loud noises") ➞ "noud loises"

spoonerise("chow mein") ➞ "mow chein"

spoonerise("edabit rules!") ➞ "redabit ules!"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Only two words will be parsed into the function. Don't worry about handling more than two.
*) You won't always just have to swap the first letters, take care to notice which letters have been switched in the examples (notice the difference between vowel-starting and consonant-starting words).
