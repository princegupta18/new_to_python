####  Parity of the Smallest Integer  ####

Write a function that returns the smallest integer in a list with its corresponding index and its parity. Even though this challenge can be achieved easily with the modulo operator %, index() and min() methods, these have been restricted to augment the challenge's level of difficulty.


[Output Structure]

___
{"@index " + index_of_smallest: smallest_integer, "parity": "odd|even"}
_____



[Examples]

___
bitwise_one_zero([107, 19, -18, -79, 36, 23, 97]) ➞ {"@index 3": -79, "parity": "odd"}

bitwise_one_zero([31, 7, 2, 13, 7, 9, 10, 13]) ➞ {"@index 2": 2, "parity": "even"}

bitwise_one_zero([3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ➞ {"@index 0": 3, "parity": "odd"}

Check Whether the Number Is Odd or Even Without Using Mod Operator
https://www.faceprep.in/c/check-whether-the-number-is-odd-or-even-without-using-mod-operator/
It is very simple to find if the given number is either odd or even without using the modulus operator. Even without using the modulus operator, a number can be checked …
