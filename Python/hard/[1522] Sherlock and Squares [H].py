####  Sherlock and Squares  ####

Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value describing a range of integers. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range, inclusive of the endpoints (note that a square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49).
For example, the range is a=24 and b=49, inclusive. There are three square integers in the range: 25, 36 and 49.
Complete the squares function that returns an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from a to b.


[Examples]

___
squares(3, 9) ➞ 2

squares(17, 24) ➞ 0

squares(1, 1000000000) ➞ 31622
