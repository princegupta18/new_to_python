####  Find Highest Occurrence  ####

Create a function that takes a list, finds the most repeated element(s) within it and returns it/them in a list. The function should work for both integers and strings mixed together within the input list (e.g. [1, 1, "a"]).


[Examples]

___
highest_occurrence([2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2]) ➞ [2]

highest_occurrence([1, 2, 3, 3, "a", "b", "b", "c"]) ➞ [3, "b"]

highest_occurrence(["it", "keeps", "coding", "on", "or", "it", "gets", "the", "hose"]) ➞ ["it"]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If there is a tie for highest occurrence, return both (see second example above).
*) Don't let integers become strings and/or string become integers in the result.
*) If returning multiple elements, sort result alphabetically with numbers coming before strings.
