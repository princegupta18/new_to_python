####  Simple Symbols  ####

Create a function that takes a string and determine if it's a valid sequence by either returning True or False. The string will be composed of + and = symbols with several characters between them (e.g. "++d+===+c++==a") and for the string to be True, each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol. So the string to the left would be False.


[Examples]

___
simple_symbols("f++d+") ➞ False

simple_symbols("+d+=3=+s+") ➞ True

simple_symbols("==+p+++++++++====8+z++++") ➞ True
_____



[Notes]

The given string will not be empty and will have at least one letter.
