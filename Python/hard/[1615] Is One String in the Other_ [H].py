####  Is One String in the Other?  ####

Create a function that takes two strings and returns True if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string. Return False otherwise. The character * is a wildcard, so it can take the place of any character.


[Examples]

___
overlap("ABC", "Ican'tsingmyABC") ➞ True

overlap("abc", "Ican'tsingmyABC") ➞ True

overlap("Ican'tsingmyABC", "abc") ➞ True

overlap("hello world", "hello") ➞ False

overlap("+=", "this should work too +=") ➞ True

overlap("hey", "*********") ➞ True
_____



[Notes]

Your function should NOT be case sensitive (see example #2).
