####  Super Strict Grading  ####

Given a dictionary of student names and a list of their test scores over the semester, return a list of all the students who passed the course (in alphabetical order). However, there is one more thing to mention: the pass mark is 100% in everything!


[Examples]

___
who_passed({
  "John" : ["5/5", "50/50", "10/10", "10/10"],
  "Sarah" : ["4/8", "50/57", "7/10", "10/18"],
  "Adam" : ["8/10", "22/25", "3/5", "5/5"],
  "Barry" : ["3/3", "20/20"]
}) ➞ ["Barry", "John"]

who_passed({
  "Zara" : ["10/10"],
  "Kris" : ["30/30"],
  "Charlie" : ["100/100"],
  "Alex" : ["1/1"]
}) ➞ ["Alex", "Charlie", "Kris", "Zara"]

who_passed({
  "Zach" : ["10/10", "2/4"],
  "Fred" : ["7/9", "2/3"]
}) ➞ []
