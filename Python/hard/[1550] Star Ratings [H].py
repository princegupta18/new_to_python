####  Star Ratings  ####

Given a list of five values, calculate the average star rating, rounded to two decimal places. The list contains user votes per star, so the first element [0] contains the number of 1-star ratings and the last element [4], the number of 5-star ratings.
Return the average score in [brackets], followed by a space and asterisks' * to represent the star rating, rounded to the nearest whole star.
