####  Factor Tractor  ####

Write a function to find all the prime factors of a given integer. The function must return a list containing all the prime factors, sorted in ascending order. Remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite and should not be included in your output list.


[Examples]

___
prime_factorize(25) ➞ [5, 5]

prime_factorize(19) ➞ [19]

prime_factorize(77) ➞ [7, 11]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Output list must be sorted in ascending order.
*) The only positive integer which is neither prime nor composite is 1. Return an empty list if 1 is the input.
