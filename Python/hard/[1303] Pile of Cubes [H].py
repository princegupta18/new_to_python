####  Pile of Cubes  ####

Mubashir needs your help to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.
Given the total volume m of the building, can you find the number of cubes n required for the building?
In other words, you have to return an integer n such that:
___
n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 == m
_____

Return None if there is no such number.


[Examples]

___
pile_of_cubes(1071225) ➞ 45

pile_of_cubes(4183059834009) ➞ 2022

pile_of_cubes(16) ➞ None
