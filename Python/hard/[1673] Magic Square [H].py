####  Magic Square  ####

In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.
Create a function that takes a square list as an argument and returns a Boolean (if it is: True, if it isn't: False).
