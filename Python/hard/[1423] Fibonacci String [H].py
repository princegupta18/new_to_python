####  Fibonacci String  ####

A Fibonacci string is a precedence of the Fibonacci series. It works with any two characters of the English alphabet (as opposed to the numbers 0 and 1 in the Fibonacci series) as the initial items and concatenates them together as it progresses in a similar fashion as the Fibonacci series.
