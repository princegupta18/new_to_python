####  Count the Primes within a Range  ####

Given two integers create a function that counts the number of primes between the two given integers.


[Examples]

___
prime_count(1, 10) ➞ 4
# range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
# answer = 4

prime_count(1, 100) ➞ 25

prime_count(1, 1000) ➞ 168
_____



[Notes]

If there are no primes within the given range, return 0.
