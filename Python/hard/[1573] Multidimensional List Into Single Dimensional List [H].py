####  Multidimensional List Into Single Dimensional List  ####

Create a function that takes a multi-dimensional list and converts it (recursively) into a single-dimensional list and returns it. Use a RECURSIVE approach.


[Examples]

___
flatten([[17.2, 5, "code"]]) ➞ [17.2, 5, "code"]

flatten([[[[[2, 14, "rubber"]]], 2, 3, 4]])) ➞ [2, 14, "rubber", 2, 3, 4]

flatten([["dimension"]]) ➞ ["dimension"]
