####  Find the LCM of Three Numbers  ####

Create a function that takes an array of three numbers and returns the Least Common Multiple (LCM).
The LCM is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. In our case, we are dealing with three numbers.
___
*) Multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on.
*) Multiples of 4 are: 4, 8,12, and so on.
*) Multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, and so on.
___

Thus, the least common multiple of 3, 4, and 12 is 12.


[Examples]

___
lcm_three([5, 7, 13]) ➞ 455

lcm_three([104, 105, 107]) ➞ 1168440

lcm_three([19, 47, 43]) ➞ 38399

LCM of Given Array Elements
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcm-of-given-array-elements/
Given an array of n numbers, find LCM of it. The idea here is to extend our relation for more than 2 numbers. Let’s say we have an array arr[] that contains n elements …
