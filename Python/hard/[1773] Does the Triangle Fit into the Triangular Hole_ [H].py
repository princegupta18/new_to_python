####  Does the Triangle Fit into the Triangular Hole?  ####

Create a function that takes the dimensions of two triangles (as lists) and checks if the first triangle fits into the second one.


[Examples]

___
does_triangle_fit([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]) ➞ True

does_triangle_fit([1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]) ➞ True

does_triangle_fit([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2]) ➞ False

does_triangle_fit([1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 6]) ➞ False
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Triangle fits if it has the same or smaller size as the hole.
*) The function should return False if the triangle with that dimensions is not possible.
