####  Alternating between Numbers Two and Eight with a Catch  ####

You can only use the following arithmetic operators: addition of numbers +, subtraction of numbers -, multiplication of number *, division of number /, and exponentiation **.
You are not allowed to use any other methods in this challenge (i.e. no if statements, comparison operators, etc).
