####  Divide Array into Chunks  ####

Write a function that divides a list into chunks of size n, where n is the length of each chunk.


[Examples]

___
chunkify([2, 3, 4, 5], 2) ➞ [[2, 3], [4, 5]]

chunkify([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) ➞ [[2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]

chunkify([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3) ➞ [[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]

chunkify([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 1) ➞ [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]

chunkify([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 7) ➞ [[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]

[Notes]

___
*) It's O.K. if the last chunk is not completely filled (see example #2).
*) Integers will always be single-digit.
