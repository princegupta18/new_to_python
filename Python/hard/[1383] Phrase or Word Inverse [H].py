####  Phrase or Word Inverse  ####

[Examples]

___
inverter("This is Valhalla", "P") ➞ "Valhalla is this"

inverter("One fine day to start", "W") ➞ "Eno enif yad ot trats"

inverter("Division by powers of two", "P") ➞ "Two of powers by division"

[Notes]

___
*) The first character of the returned string should be in uppercase and the rest are in lowercase.
