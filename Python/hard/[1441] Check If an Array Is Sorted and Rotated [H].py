####  Check If an Array Is Sorted and Rotated  ####

Given a list of distinct integers, create a function that checks if the list is sorted and rotated clockwise. If so, return "YES"; otherwise return "NO".


[Examples]

___
check([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]) ➞ "YES"
# The above list is sorted and rotated.
# Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
# Rotating this sorted list clockwise
# by 3 positions, we get: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].

check([1, 2, 3]) ➞ "NO"
# The above list is sorted but not rotated.

check([7, 9, 11, 12, 5]) ➞ "YES"
# The above list is sorted and rotated.
# Sorted list: [5, 7, 9, 11, 12].
# Rotating this sorted list clockwise
# by 4 positions, we get: [7, 9, 11, 12, 5].

Shifting a list rotates its elements. Elements moved off the end are rotated to the beginning. For example, shifting [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5] twice to the right results in [4, 5 …

Returns a sorted list from the items in an iterable. In this tutorial, we will learn to sort elements in ascending and descending order using the Python shorted() function.
