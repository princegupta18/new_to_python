####  Semiprimes  ####

A semiprime is a composite number that is the product of two primes. Apart from these two primes, its only other proper (non-self) divisor is 1.
The two prime factors of a semiprime can be the same number (e.g. the semiprime 49 is the product of 7x7). A semiprime that has two distinct prime factors is called a squarefree semiprime.
Create a function that takes a number and returns "Squarefree Semiprime", "Semiprime", or "Neither".


[Examples]

___
semiprime(49) ➞ "Semiprime"

semiprime(15) ➞ "Squarefree Semiprime"

semiprime(97) ➞ "Neither"
