####  Sorting Time  ####

Python has a beautiful built-in function sorted that sorts an iterable, usually an array of numbers, sorting them in ascending order, but using key= you can sort the iterable in different ways.
Create a function that takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the same array in ascending order. Using sorted() would be easy, but for this challenge YOU have to sort the array creating your own algorithm.


[Examples]

___
sort_array([2, -5, 1, 4, 7, 8]) ➞ [-5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

sort_array([23, 15, 34, 17, -28]) ➞ [-28, 15, 17, 23, 34]

sort_array([38, 57, 45, 18, 47, 39]) ➞ [18, 38, 39, 45, 47, 57]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The arrays can contain either positive or negative elements.
*) The arrays will only contain integers.
*) The arrays won't contain duplicate numbers.
*) This is a challenge to enhance your ability, using the sorted built-in won't enhance your skills.
