####  Deep List Count  ####

Create a function that takes a list and returns the number of ALL elements within it (including those within the sub-level list(s)).


[Examples]

___
deep_count([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 3

deep_count([[1], [2], [3]]) ➞ 6

deep_count(["x", "y", ["z"]]) ➞ 4

deep_count(["a", "b", ["c", "d", ["e"]]]) ➞ 7
_____



[Notes]

In the examples above, notice how the sub-lists within the main list count as an element as well as the elements within that sub-list.
