####  Filter Primes from a List  ####

Create a function that takes a list and returns a new list containing only prime numbers.


[Examples]

___
filter_primes([7, 9, 3, 9, 10, 11, 27]) ➞ [7, 3, 11]

filter_primes([10007, 1009, 1007, 27, 147, 77, 1001, 70]) ➞ [10007, 1009]

filter_primes([1009, 10, 10, 10, 3, 33, 9, 4, 1, 61, 63, 69, 1087, 1091, 1093, 1097]) ➞ [1009, 3, 61, 1087, 1091, 1093, 1097]

[Notes]

___
*) New list must maintain the order of primes as they first appear in the original list.

Function to Check for a Prime Number with Python
https://linuxconfig.org/function-to-check-for-a-prime-number-with-python
Below is a simple function to check for a prime number. The function is_prime_number() returns False if the number supplied is less than 2 and if the number is equally …

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

Fermat Primality Test
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test
In order to check if a number is prime, just check a**(n-1)%n == 1. If you do so t times, the probability that n is not prime is (1/4)**t for 1 < a < n-1.
