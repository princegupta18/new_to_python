####  Anonymous Name  ####

You are in the process of creating a chat application and want to add an anonymous name feature. This anonymous name feature will create an alias that consists of two capitalized words beginning with the same letter as the users first name.
Create a function that determines if the list of users is mapped to a list of anonymous names correctly.


[Examples]

___
is_correct_aliases(["Adrian M.", "Harriet S.", "Mandy T."], ["Amazing Artichoke", "Hopeful Hedgehog", "Marvelous Mouse"]) ➞ True

is_correct_aliases(["Rachel F.", "Pam G.", "Fred Z.", "Nancy K."], ["Reassuring Rat", "Peaceful Panda", "Fantastic Frog", "Notable Nickel"]) ➞ True

is_correct_aliases(["Beth T."], ["Brandishing Mimosa"]) ➞ False
# Both words in "Brandishing Mimosa" should begin with a "B" - "Brandishing Beaver" would do the trick.
_____



[Notes]

Both words in the alias should be capitalized.
