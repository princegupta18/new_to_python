Given a number, find the "round" of each digit of the number. An integer is called "round" if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero.
___
*) Round numbers: 4000, 1, 9, 800, 90
*) Not round numbers: 110, 707, 222, 1001
___

Create a function that takes a number and returns the "round" of each digit (except if the digit is zero) as a string. Check out the following examples for more clarification.


[Examples]

___
sum_round(101) ➞ "1 100"

sum_round(1234) ➞ "4 30 200 1000"

sum_round(54210) ➞ "10 200 4000 50000"
