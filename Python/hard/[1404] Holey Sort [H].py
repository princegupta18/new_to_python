####  Holey Sort  ####

What do the numbers 4, 6, 8, 9 and 0 have in common? They all have holes in them! Notice how the number 8 contains not one, but two holes.
Given a list of numbers, sort the list in accordance to how many holes occur in the number. It should be sorted in ascending order.


[Examples]

___
holey_sort([44, 4, 444, 4444]) ➞ [4, 44, 444, 4444]

holey_sort([100, 888, 1660, 11]) ➞ [11, 100, 1660, 888]

holey_sort([8, 121, 41, 66]) ➞ [121, 41, 8, 66]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If two numbers have the same number of holes in them, sort them by the order they first appeared in.
*) Despite the number 0 appearing to have two holes in certain fonts, it will only have one hole for the purposes of this challenge.
