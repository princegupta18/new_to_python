####  Powerful Prime Factor  ####

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns a string expressing how the number can be made by multiplying powers of its prime factors.


[Examples]

___
express_factors(2) ➞ "2"

express_factors(4) ➞ "2^2"

express_factors(10) ➞ "2 x 5"

express_factors(60) ➞ "2^2 x 3 x 5"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All inputs will be positive integers in the range 1 < n < 10,000.
*) If a factor is repeated express it in the form "x^y" where x is the factor and y is the number of repetitions of the factor.
*) If n is a prime number, return n as a string as in example #1 above.
*) Factors should appear in ascending order in the expression.
*) Make sure you include the space either side of the multiplication sign, " x ".
*) Check the Resources if you need to understand Prime Factorization.
