####  Burglary Series (23): Find and Remove  ####

The insurance guy calls. They were about to pay you all that fortune you've been anxiously waiting for, but they detected further irregularities; the list of stolen items is misformatted and appears to contain other entries that don't belong there. Find and remove them.
You receive a dict with nested dicts with strings as values. Convert their values to number and return a dict with entries that evaluate to type int.
