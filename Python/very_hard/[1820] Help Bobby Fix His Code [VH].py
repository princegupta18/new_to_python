####  Help Bobby Fix His Code  ####

Bobby is troubleshooting a challenge he is attempting on Edabit. He needs to devise a function whose argument is the size of a square array. The function must return the array with the diagonals set to 1 and all the other members set to 0. His code is in the Code tab. Two of the lines contain bugs. Can you help him?
