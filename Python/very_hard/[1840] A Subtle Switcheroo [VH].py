####  A Subtle Switcheroo  ####

Create a function which replaces all instances of "nts" with "nce" and vice versa if they are at the end of a word.

switcheroo("The elephants in France were chased by ants!") ➞ "The elephance in Frants were chased by ance!"

switcheroo("While he rants, I fall into a trance...") ➞ "While he rance, I fall into a trants..."
