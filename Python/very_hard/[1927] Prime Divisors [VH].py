####  Prime Divisors  ####

Given a number, return all its prime divisors in a list. Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns all its prime divisors.
To illustrate:
___
*) If n = 27
*) All divisors are: [3, 9, 27]
*) Finally, from that list of divisors, return the prime ones: [3]
___



[Examples]

___
prime_divisors(27) ➞ [3]

prime_divisors(99) ➞ [3, 11]

prime_divisors(3457) ➞ [3457]

The code above, as written, would work; however, this is partly lucky. The isPrime function was inaccurate, as range doesn't include the higher end, so e.g. if checkin …
