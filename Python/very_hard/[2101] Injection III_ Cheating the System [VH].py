####  Injection III: Cheating the System  ####

The bookstore from this collection has increased their security again. After setting the variable res, an if statement checks if res is equal to the users dictionary. If it is, it sends an error. Create a query that copies users to res.


[Examples]

___
param = "your text here"

users = {
  "user1": "password",
  "user2": "password"
}

res = eval("search("%s")" % param)

if res == users:
  res = {"Error": "No products found."}

print(res) ➞ users

[Notes]

___
*) Create a string, not a function.
*) For readability, try to break your string into smaller substrings.
*) As an anti-cheat measure, naming a variable x_x is prohibited.
