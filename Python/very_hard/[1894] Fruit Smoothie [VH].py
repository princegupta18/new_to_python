Create a class Smoothie and do the following:
___
*) Create an instance attribute called ingredients.
*) Create a get_cost method which calculates the total cost of the ingredients used to make the smoothie.
*) Create a get_price method which returns the number from get_cost plus the number from get_cost multiplied by 1.5. Round to two decimal places.
*) Create a get_name method which gets the ingredients and puts them in alphabetical order into a nice descriptive sentence. If there are multiple ingredients, add the word "Fusion" to the end but otherwise, add "Smoothie". Remember to change "-berries" to "-berry". See the examples below.
