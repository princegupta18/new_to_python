####  Get Sqrt of a Number Using Bisection Search  ####

Create a function that uses bisection search to compute the approximative value of the square root of a number.
___
*) Use any integer or float as an argument.
*) Use a delta variable of 0.01 to know when a result is valid (i.e. if the result squared is between n - delta and n + delta, it's considered valid).
___



[Examples]

___
bisec_sqrt(69) ➞ 8.307

bisec_sqrt(16) ➞ 4.0

bisec_sqrt(12984771) ➞ 3603.439

bisec_sqrt(12.21) ➞ 3.494
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Round values up to 3 digits (round() method).
*) Please use bisection search: it may take more lines but the efficiency is incredible!
