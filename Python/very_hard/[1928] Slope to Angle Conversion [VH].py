####  Slope to Angle Conversion  ####

Given a slope of a line, calculate and return the value of the angle of line (relative to the y -axis). For example, a horizontal line would be 90 degrees.


[Examples]

___
convert(1) ➞ 45

convert(0) ➞ 90

convert(-1) ➞ 135
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All values returned should be in degrees.
*) All values returned should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
*) The value to return must be strictly between 0 and 180.
*) All inputs will be valid integer values.
