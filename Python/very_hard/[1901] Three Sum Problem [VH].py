####  Three Sum Problem  ####

Write a function that returns all sets of three elements that sum to 0.


[Examples]

___
three_sum([0, 1, -1, -1, 2]) ➞ [[0, 1, -1], [-1, -1, 2]]

three_sum([0, 0, 0, 5, -5]) ➞ [[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, -5]]

three_sum([1, 2, 3]) ➞ []

three_sum([1]) ➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The original list may contain duplicate numbers.
*) Each three-element sublist in your output should be distinct.
*) Sublists should be ordered by the first element of the sublist.
*) Sublists themselves should be ordered the same as the original list.
*) Return an empty list if no three elements sum to zero.
*) Return an empty list if there are fewer than three elements.
