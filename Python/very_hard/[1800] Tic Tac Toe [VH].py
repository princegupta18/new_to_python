####  Tic Tac Toe  ####

Given a 3x3 matrix of a completed tic-tac-toe game, create a function that returns whether the game is a win for "X", "O", or a "Draw", where "X" and "O" represent themselves on the matrix, and "E" represents an empty spot.


[Examples]

___
tic_tac_toe([
  ["X", "O", "X"],
  ["O", "X",  "O"],
  ["O", "X",  "X"]
]) ➞ "X"

tic_tac_toe([
  ["O", "O", "O"],
  ["O", "X", "X"],
  ["E", "X", "X"]
]) ➞ "O"

tic_tac_toe([
  ["X", "X", "O"],
  ["O", "O", "X"],
  ["X", "X", "O"]
]) ➞ "Draw"
_____



[Notes]

Make sure that if O wins, you return the letter "O" and not the integer 0 (zero) and if it's a draw, make sure you return the capitalised word "Draw". If you return "X" or "O", make sure they're capitalised too.
