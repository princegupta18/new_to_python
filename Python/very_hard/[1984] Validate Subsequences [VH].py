####  Validate Subsequences  ####

Given two non-empty lists, write a function that determines whether the second list is a subsequence of the first list.
For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the list [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4].


[Examples]

___
is_valid_subsequence([1, 1, 6, 1],[1, 1, 1, 6]) ➞ False

is_valid_subsequence([5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], [22, 25, 6]) ➞ True

is_valid_subsequence([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4]) ➞ True
