####  Freshly Made Pizzas  ####

Create a Pizza class with the attributes order_number and ingredients (which is given as a list). Only the ingredients will be given as input.
You should also make it so that its possible to choose a ready made pizza flavour rather than typing out the ingredients manually! As well as creating this Pizza class, hard-code the following pizza flavours.



[Examples]

___
p1 = Pizza(["bacon", "parmesan", "ham"])    # order 1
p2 = Pizza.garden_feast()                  # order 2
_____

___
p1.ingredients ➞ ["bacon", "parmesan", "ham"]

p2.ingredients ➞ ["spinach", "olives", "mushroom"]

p1.order_number ➞ 1

p2.order_number ➞ 2
