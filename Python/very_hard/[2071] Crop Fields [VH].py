####  Crop Fields  ####

You're given a 2D list / matrix of a crop field. Each crop needs a water source. Each water source hydrates the 8 tiles around it. With "w" representing a water source, and "c" representing a crop, is every crop hydrated?


[Examples]

___
crop_hydrated([
  [ "w", "c" ],
  [ "w", "c" ],
  [ "c", "c" ]
]) ➞ True

crop_hydrated([
  [ "c", "c", "c" ]
]) ➞ False
# There isn"t even a water source.

crop_hydrated([
  [ "c", "c", "c", "c" ],
  [ "w", "c", "c", "c" ],
  [ "c", "c", "c", "c" ],
  [ "c", "w", "c", "c" ]
]) ➞ False
_____



[Notes]

"w" on its own should return True, and "c" on its own should return False.
