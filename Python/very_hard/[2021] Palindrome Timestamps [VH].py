####  Palindrome Timestamps  ####

Create a function that takes two times of day (hours, minutes, seconds) and returns the number of occurences of palindrome timestamps within that range, inclusive.
A palindrome timestamp should be read the same hours : minutes : seconds as seconds : minutes : hours, keeping in mind the seconds and hours digits will reverse. For example, 02 : 11 : 20 is a palindrome timestamp.


[Examples]

___
palindrome_time([2, 12, 22, 4, 35, 10]) ➞ 14

palindrome_time([12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13]) ➞ 6

palindrome_time([6, 33, 15, 9, 55, 10]) ➞ 0
_____



[Notes]

Input list contains six numbers [h1, m1, s1, h2, m2, s2] for begin and end timestamps.
