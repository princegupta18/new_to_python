####  Advanced List Sort  ####

Create a function that takes a list of numbers or strings and returns a list with the items from the original list stored into sublists. Items of the same value should be in the same sublist.


[Examples]

___
advanced_sort([2, 1, 2, 1]) ➞ [[2, 2], [1, 1]]

advanced_sort([5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3]) ➞ [[5, 5, 5], [4, 4], [3]]

advanced_sort(["b", "a", "b", "a", "c"]) ➞ [["b", "b"], ["a", "a"], ["c"]]
_____



[Notes]

The sublists should be returned in the order of each element's first appearance in the given list.
