####  Dakti ðŸŒŠðŸŒ´  ####

Juan loves the Dakti song and wants to memorize the chorus of the song. His friend sent him the chorus in phrases, but the phrases are somewhat strange; they do not have an order and they have numbers. His friend helps Juan organize the chorus of the song.
Use RegEx, natural sorting, sorting, or lambda functions; your imagination has no limits.
