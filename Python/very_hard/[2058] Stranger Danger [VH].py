####  Stranger Danger  ####

For this challenge, the input will be a (long) string.
A word encountered for the first time is a stranger. A word encountered thrice becomes an acquaintance. A word encountered 5 times becomes a friend.
Create a function that takes the string and returns a list of two lists. The first is a list of acquaintances in the order they became an acquaintance (see example). The second is a list of friends in the order they became a friend. Words on the friend list should no longer be on the acquaintance list.


[Examples]

___
no_strangers("See Spot run. See Spot jump. Spot likes jumping. See Spot fly.")
âžž [["spot", "see"], []]
# "see" was encountered first, but "spot" became an acquaintance earlier.
_____



[Notes]
